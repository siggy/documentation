      <description>If you believe you&amp;rsquo;ve identified a security vulnerability in Mastodon (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible), you should send the report to hello@joinmastodon.org. We will gladly reward such reports in proportion to the severity of the issue through our OpenCollective fund.
You should not report such issues on GitHub or in other public spaces to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing Mastodon&amp;rsquo;s users to increased risk.</description>

      <description>config/routes.rb Explanation of routes Mastodon uses Ruby on Rails, which defines its router configuration at config/routes.rb. You may view the Ruby on Rails routing guide for more detailed information, but this page will explain the basics of how Mastodon handles routing.
How routes are constructed namespace is a prefix for routes mapped to a certain controller directory. resources are mapped to controllers within that namespace directory. scope passes to the module&amp;rsquo;s controller.</description>

      <title>Setting up a dev environment</title>

      <description>This page is under construction. Pre-requisites You can follow the pre-requisites instructions from the production guide, but do not create a mastodon user. You also don&amp;rsquo;t have to install nginx, certbot and python-certbot-nginx as the development environment brings its own webserver. Setting up and running a development environment has been proven successful over WSL2 as well if you are on Windows.
Setup Run following commands in the project directory bundle install, yarn install.</description>

      <description>This page is under construction. Mastodon is a Ruby on Rails application with a React.js front-end. It follows standard practices of those frameworks, so if you are already familiar with Rails or React.js, you will not find any surprises here.
The best way of working with Mastodon in a development environment is installing all the dependencies on your system, rather than using Docker or Vagrant. You need Ruby, Node.js, PostgreSQL and Redis, which is a pretty standard set of dependencies for Rails applications.</description>
